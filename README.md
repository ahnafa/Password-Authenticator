# Password-Authenticator
A basic password autheticator in plain JavaScript


## Criteria for subsequent versions:

Here are the 4 criteria that we will check:

-Password length

-Presence of at least one lowecase character and at least one uppercase character

-Presence of at leasr one number among the characters of the password

-Presence of at least one special character


Our criteria are rather simplistic but in the context of a basic Android application, they are perfectly legitimate.
